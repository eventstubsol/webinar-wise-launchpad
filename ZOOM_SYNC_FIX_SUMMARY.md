# Zoom Webinar Sync Fix Summary

## Issue
The Zoom webinar sync was not properly populating all fields in the `zoom_webinars` table, particularly:
- Password fields (password, h323_password, encrypted_password, etc.)
- Settings object (was storing empty object `{}`)
- Registration URL

## Root Cause
The Zoom API returns webinar data with some fields in the root object and others nested within a `settings` object. The sync function wasn't properly extracting and mapping all these fields.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced Field Extraction Logic
- Added comprehensive logging to understand the Zoom API response structure
- Check both root level and settings object for all fields
- Extract password from join URL if not provided in API response
- Store complete settings object instead of empty object

### 2. Password Extraction
Added logic to extract password from join URL when not available in API response:
```typescript
// Extract password from the join URL if not available in response
let extractedPassword = null;
if (!webinar.password && !settings.password && webinar.join_url) {
  const pwdMatch = webinar.join_url.match(/pwd=([^&]+)/);
  if (pwdMatch) {
    extractedPassword = pwdMatch[1];
    console.log(`ðŸ”‘ Extracted password from join URL for webinar ${webinar.id}`);
  }
}
```

### 3. Improved Field Mapping
Updated the `storeWebinarInDatabase` function to:
- Check multiple locations for URLs (root, settings, settings.registrants_confirmation_email)
- Properly handle password fields from all possible locations
- Store settings object only if it has content
- Better determination of registration_required based on multiple factors

### 4. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging to help debug issues:
- Log full webinar structure for first 3 webinars during sync
- Log analysis of webinar structure (which fields are present where)
- Log password field population status

## Files Modified
1. `/supabase/functions/zoom-sync-webinars/simple-sync-processor.ts`
   - Enhanced the `storeWebinarInDatabase` function
   - Added password extraction logic
   - Improved field mapping
   - Added comprehensive logging

## Testing
Created `test-webinar-sync.js` to help test the edge function manually.

## Next Steps
1. Run a sync using the sync button in your app
2. Check the edge function logs for the detailed webinar structure
3. Verify that password fields and settings are now being populated correctly
4. Monitor the sync logs table for any errors

## How to Use the Test Script
1. Get your credentials:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console after logging in:
   const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
   console.log('Access Token:', session.access_token);
   ```

2. Get your connection ID:
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL editor:
   SELECT id, zoom_email FROM zoom_connections 
   WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
   ```

3. Update the test script with your credentials and run:
   ```bash
   node test-webinar-sync.js
   ```

## Verification
After running a sync, check if fields are populated:
```sql
SELECT 
  webinar_id,
  topic,
  password,
  h323_password,
  encrypted_password,
  settings,
  registration_url
FROM zoom_webinars
WHERE connection_id = 'YOUR_CONNECTION_ID'
ORDER BY synced_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

The sync should now properly extract and store all webinar fields from the Zoom API!
