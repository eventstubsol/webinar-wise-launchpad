# Zoom Sync Fix Summary - RLS Policy Issue Resolved

## Issue Description
The Zoom webinar sync was completing but showing "0/43 webinars processed" because the edge function couldn't write to the database due to Row Level Security (RLS) policy issues.

## Root Cause
The RLS policies for the `zoom_webinars`, `zoom_participants`, and `zoom_registrants` tables were checking for `auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role'`, which doesn't work correctly when using the service role key with `createClient()`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed RLS Policies
Updated the service role policies to use the proper Supabase RLS syntax:

```sql
-- For zoom_webinars table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can manage all webinars" ON zoom_webinars;
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage all webinars" ON zoom_webinars
  FOR ALL
  TO service_role
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Similar updates for zoom_participants and zoom_registrants tables
```

### 2. Key Changes
- Changed from checking JWT claims to using `TO service_role` directive
- This allows the edge function using the service role key to bypass RLS completely
- Applied the same fix to all related tables

## Edge Function Status
The edge function (`zoom-sync-webinars`) was already correctly implemented:
- Version 143 is currently deployed
- It properly creates a service role client for database operations
- The sync logic is comprehensive and includes participant/registrant syncing

## Testing Instructions

1. **Get your session token:**
   - Open Webinar Wise in your browser
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Application > Local Storage
   - Find the entry starting with "sb-guwvvinnifypcxwbcnzz"
   - Copy the "access_token" value

2. **Run the test script:**
   ```bash
   export USER_JWT="your_token_here"
   node test-sync-after-fix.js
   ```

3. **Or test from the UI:**
   - Go to the Zoom Sync page
   - Click the Sync button
   - Watch the console for progress updates

## Expected Results
- The sync should now properly process all 43 webinars
- Webinar data including passwords, settings, and URLs should be stored
- Participant and registrant data should be synced for eligible webinars
- The sync log should show "completed" status with processed_items = total_items

## Additional Notes
- The edge function processes webinars in batches of 10 to avoid timeouts
- It fetches participants for up to 5 webinars per sync to manage API limits
- All password fields are properly extracted from multiple sources
- The sync maintains proper error handling and retry logic

## Next Steps
1. Run a test sync to verify the fix works
2. Monitor the sync logs for successful completion
3. Check that all webinar data is properly stored in the database
4. If successful, the issue is fully resolved

## Files Modified
- No code files were modified
- Only database RLS policies were updated via migrations

## Migrations Applied
1. `fix_zoom_webinars_service_role_policy`
2. `fix_participants_registrants_service_role_policies`
