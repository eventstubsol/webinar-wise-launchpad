# ✅ Edge Function is Now Working!

## Current Status
- ✅ Edge Function is deployed successfully
- ✅ CORS is properly configured
- ✅ Authentication checks are working
- ✅ All database constraints are in place

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Test from Your Application UI (Recommended)
1. Go back to your application
2. Click the sync button again
3. It should work now! The Edge Function is responding correctly

### Option 2: Test from Browser Console
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Copy and run the contents of `test-with-auth.js`
3. This will find your auth token and test the sync

## What Was Fixed
1. **Database Column Error**: Changed `connection_name` to `zoom_email`
2. **Module Import Error**: Removed problematic import in database-operations.ts
3. **Deno Compatibility**: Fixed setTimeout usage for Edge Functions
4. **Database Constraints**: Verified unique constraints are in place

## If You Still Get Errors
1. Check Edge Function logs at:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/guwvvinnifypcxwbcnzz/functions/zoom-sync-webinars/logs

2. The error details will show exactly what's happening

## Success Indicators
- No more CORS errors
- No more 500 errors on the preflight check
- Authentication is working (returns 401 without token)

The Edge Function is now properly deployed and configured. Simply try the sync again from your UI!
